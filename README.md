# csc413_Rainbow_Reef
A reupload of the second game I made for CSC 413 at SFSU (Fall 2018).

This project contains the second part of the assignment https://github.com/atremarc/csc413_Tank_Game was a part of. The intention of the two pieces of the assignment was to ask students to demonstrate an ability to design software general enough in their tank game projects that it could be quickly adapted into another game. For my adaptation I chose the 'Breakout' clone 'Rainbow Reef'. This one is a little buggy (sometimes the ball bounces out of bounds), but the game still showcases object designs which exemplify the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, and modularity.

## To run this game:

Simply run the RainbowReef_jar/RainbowReef.jar file of this repository.

Control the paddle with the arrow keys.
